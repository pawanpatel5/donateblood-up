        <p>She visited our school and explained to us about CodeYogi</p>
        <p>and how it helps students learn coding in a practical, easy, and free of cost manner.</p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project is a Blood Donation Website prototype created for learning and demonstration purposes.</p>
        <p>It is not a live or working website, but a project concept.</p>
        <p>The project shows how donor registration and blood request forms can be designed.</p>
        <p>Users can enter details like blood group, contact number, and location.</p>
        <p>It is built using <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span>, and basic <span>JavaScript</span>.</p>
        <p>This project helped me understand real-world website structure and form design</p>
